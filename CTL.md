# Conceptual Topology Logic: Semantic Logic

# Logical Operations in Conceptual Topology

| Logical Symbol | CTL Example         | Categorical Structure       |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| ⊤ (true)       | The concept of truth | Terminal object `1`         |
| ⊥ (false)      | A null concept       | Initial object `0` or Zero morphism |
| ¬p (not p)     | `σ(Z).Not(f)`        | Zero morphism (rupture)     |
| ¬¬p            | `Equalizer(σ∘σ, id)` | Equalizer (closure of negation) |
| p ∧ q          | `girl ∧ dog ≅ mammal` | Pullback (common intersection) |
| p ∨ q          | `dog ∨ cat ≅ pet`    | Coproduct (union of categories) |
| p ⇒ q          | `dog ⇒ mammal`      | Exponential object (`Hom(p, q)`) |
| p ⇔ q          | `girl ⇔ woman`     | Isomorphism (bidirectional morphism)|
| p = q          | `girl = girl`        | Identiy Morphism (conceptual identity) |
| p ≒ q          | `girl = girl`        | Isomorphism  (conceptual identity) |
| ∃x. P(x)       | `∃ dog. dog ∈ pet`   | Co-limit (existential quantification) |
| ∀x. P(x)       | `∀ dog. dog ∈ mammal`| Limit (universal quantification) |

**XOR**
```
p ⊻ q := (p ∨ q) ⊖ (p ∧ q)
girl ⊻ woman | Female
= (girl ∨ woman | Female )  ⊖  (girl ∧ woman | Female )
= (female | Female )  ⊖  (female | Female)
= ""
```

CTL Example is simplified version. You need to clarify the Z frame as follows.
Note: The logical oprations can be applied also to Z frame.
```
girl ⇔ woman | Human ∧ Femenity
```


## Additional Definitions for Conceptual Topology

| Symbol  | Description                                  |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `↛`    | Rupture: Disruption of morphism (i.e., negation, non-constructive) |
| `| Z`   | Z-frame: Semantic contextual anchoring        |
| `σ(X)`  | Meaning shifting operator (shifting, Not, so_much, etc.) |
| `⊕, ⊖`  | Meaning composition and removal operations   |
| `Eq(f, g)` | Semantic equivalence constraint (Equalizer) |


**simbols**

```
Z : Intermediating variable (conceptual anchor; Z-frame)
| : Frame separator (indicates morphism is mediated by Z-frame)
→: Morphic Flow
↛: Ruptured morphism
F : Cross-category morphism (used in cross-category flow under shared Z-frame)
//: Used to narrate meaning flow of morphic chains.
¬: Absence

M|Z : Monoid of Conceptual Flow under Z-frame
R|Z := { rupture(f) | rupture(f, σ(f) | Z) ≠ ∅ }
e|Z : Identity element of M|Z
D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) : Morphic chain under Z frame

σ : Conceptual Shifting Morphism
>> : Generalization relation (A >> X ≡ A ⊑ X)
<< : Specialization relation (X >> A ≡ X ⊑ A)
rupture(f, σ(f) | Z) ≠ ∅ : Indicates conceptual rupture
η : Quasi-Natural Transformation: Contextual alignment between morphic chains.

⊕:  Conceptual morphism set addition in σ or morphic merger such as:
    (k₂ ∘ k₁) ⊕ (q₂ ∘ q₁) = human → royalty | Z'
⊖:  Conceptual morphism set subtraction 
    Removes specified morphisms from a morphic chain or set.
```

**Notations**
```
Concept / Word (lexeme):
    - Lower case (e.g., puppy, dog, girl, she)

Z Frame (conceptual anchor):
    - Upper case (e.g., Mammal, Human, Agency, Domesticated, Royalty)

Type variables (A, B, X, Y, Z in formal definitions):
    - Follow standard formal notation (uppercase) 

Example:
puppy → dog | Mammal
A → B | Z

Morphism: f, g, h
Functor: F
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Simplified Form of Identity Morphism:**

1. f: X → X | X  (Category-theoretic identity) </br>
　In simplified form: X </br>
  or more explicitly: id_X </br>
  
2. f: X → X | Z  (Mediated identity with conceptual flow)</br>
　In simplified form: X | Z</br>

**σ Operator**

```
σ(X). Not(x){ A ↛ B | Z}     →     Rupture under Z frame
σ(X). so_much(x){A → B | Z}  →     Preservation & amplification under Z frame
σ(X). >>(x,y)                →     Conceptual Shifting x to y (Generalization) as function form
σ(X). <<(x,y)                →     Downward Shifting x to y (Specialization) as function form
σ(X). >(x,y)                 →     Conceptual Shifting 
```

</br>

**Conceptual Morphism Set Operators**

```
Addition (⊕):
σ(X). ⊕(f, Aₙ₋₁ | Z): D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z) | Z
σ(X). ⊕(f₁, f₂) : Aₙ₋₁ :={f₁, f₂}

Subtraction (⊖):
⊖: Aₙ₋₁ ⊖ {f_i} 
σ(X). ⊖(f, Aₙ₋₁ | Z): D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z) | Z   

- ⊕ operator is σ_safe if Z alignment is preserved.
- ⊖ operator is potentially σ_unsafe but can be σ_safe if resulting chain preserves the underlying morphic continuity Z.
```

</br>

**σ Typing Hierarchy**

σ_safe: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z) | Z (Preserves global coherence)</br>
σ_unsafe: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → { rupture(f₁), ..., rupture(fₙ) | ¬Z } (Global coherence lost)

Note: σ_safe behaves as Quasi-Natural Transformation.  
      σ_unsafe induces rupture, and cannot be captured globally.
