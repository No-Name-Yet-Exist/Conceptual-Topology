| Logical Symbol | CTL Example         | Categorical Structure       |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| ⊤ (true)       | The concept of truth | Terminal object `1`         |
| ⊥ (false)      | A null concept       | Initial object `0` or Zero morphism |
| ¬p (not p)     | `σ(Z).Not(f)`        | Zero morphism (rupture)     |
| ¬¬p            | `Equalizer(σ∘σ, id)` | Equalizer (closure of negation) |
| p ∧ q          | `girl ∧ dog ≅ mammal` | Pullback (common intersection) |
| p ∨ q          | `dog ∨ cat ≅ pet`    | Coproduct (union of categories) |
| p ⇒ q          | `dog ⇒ mammal`      | Exponential object (`Hom(p, q)`) |
| p ⇔ q          | `girl ⇔ woman`     | Isomorphism (bidirectional morphism) |
| p = q          | `girl = girl`        | Identiy Morphism (conceptual identity) |
| ∃x. P(x)       | `∃ dog. dog ∈ pet`   | Co-limit (existential quantification) |
| ∀x. P(x)       | `∀ dog. dog ∈ mammal`| Limit (universal quantification) |

**XOR**
```
p ⊻ q := (p ∨ q) ⊖ (p ∧ q)
girl ⊻ woman | Female
= (girl ∨ woman | Female )  ⊖  (girl ∧ woman | Female )
= (female | Female )  ⊖  (female | Female)
= ""

CTL Example is simplified version. You need to clarify the Z frame as follows.
Note: The logical oprations can be applied also to Z frame.
```
girl ⇔ woman | Human ∧ Femenity
```


## Additional Definitions for Conceptual Topology

| Symbol  | Description                                  |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `↛`    | Rupture: Disruption of morphism (i.e., negation, non-constructive) |
| `| Z`   | Z-frame: Semantic contextual anchoring        |
| `σ(X)`  | Meaning shifting operator (shifting, Not, so_much, etc.) |
| `⊕, ⊖`  | Meaning composition and removal operations   |
| `Eq(f, g)` | Semantic equivalence constraint (Equalizer) |
