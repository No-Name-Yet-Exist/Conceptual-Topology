# Introduction
Conceptual Topos v1.0 is an initial formalization of the algebraic topology of meaning 
based on Conceptual Topology. 

This version sketches core axioms for Topos including:

- Initial Object
- Subobject Classifier Ω
- Terminal Object
- Fibered Topos structure
- Semantic Exponential via σ operator

Finite Limits (Pullbacks, Products, Equalizers) are under ongoing formalization.

Future versions (v1.x) will refine the formalization and extend it.

# Fibered Conceptual Topology:
Fibered Conceptual Topology provides a semantic geometric framework wherein each Z-frame (semantic anchor) acts as a base space, with semantic morphic flows forming fibers over these anchors. The Yoneda-like interpretation captures concepts as bundles of semantic relations within and across Z-frames. This fibered structure serves as the foundation for further constructions in Conceptual Topos. 

```
CT := (C, B, π: E → B, Fb := π⁻¹(b), A ≅ b ⋃ Nat(Hom(−, A), Fb))

Where:
  - C is the category of concepts (objects = words or concepts)
  - B is the base space of Z-frames (semantic continuity anchors)
  - E is the total semantic space (word vector embedding space)
  - π projects each concept to its semantic base (Z-frame)
  - Fb is the fiber (semantic morphic chain) over a base b
  - A ≅ b ⋃ Nat(Hom(−, A), Fb) interprets each concept A via its morphisms relative to its   Z-frame b (Yoneda perspective defined in appendix)
```

```
        Z = baby  
    puppy  ←   girl    //specified: size + young
     |          |
     |          |
    dog        she     //abstraction
      \        /      
        Mammal

```

## 1. Monoid Structure of Semantic Flow (M|Z):
In Conceptual Topology, Z is defined as a mediating point/semantic anchor.
```
Let C and D, Z be categories,
with semantic projection π: C ∪ D → Z, such that for each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D):

π(X) ∈ Ob(Z)

For each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), there exists morphism:

f_X: X → π(X)
f_X⁻¹: π(X) → X
 
such that:

f_X⁻¹ ∘ f_X ≅ id_X

For morphism f: X → Y | Z,  
this corresponds to:

f_Z: π(X) → π(Y) in Z

For any X, Y ∈ Ob(C ∪ D):

Let [X]_Z := semantic representation of X under frame Z (i.e., π(X))

Then:

[ X ]_Z1 ≅ [ Y ]_Z2 | Z1, Z2 ∈ Z //or Z1, Z2 >> Z 
which means:
["Dog"]_Pet = [Retriever, Dachshund, Poodle, Bulldog, ...]
["girl"]_Human = [girl, woman, person, ...]
["Dog"]_Pet ≅ ["girl"]_Human | Life

Then the set of semantic flow morphisms under Z forms a monoid:

M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

This is also defined as Morphic Chain:

Let **D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z)** := Category of Morphic Chains over **Ob(Cₙ₋₁)** within a given Z-frame.
where:D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z) ={ C₀ → C₁ → C₂ → ... | Z }

or as a set
D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z) ={ C₀, C₁, C₂, ... | Z }
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2. Identity Element of M|Z
```
Let: M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

Define the identity element of M|Z as a family of identity morphisms over the shared Z frame:

For each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), there exists a unique identity morphism under a Z frame:

e|Z_X := id_X | Z

Then, for any f: X → Y | Z ∈ M|Z:

e|Z_X ∘ f = f
f ∘ e|Z_Y = f   

Therefore, the identity structure of M|Z is given by the family:

{ id_X | Z | X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D) }

which forms a pointwise identity across the objects under the common Z frame.  
This ensures that M|Z satisfies the identity axiom of a monoid.
```

</br>

## 3. Associativity of M | Z
```
Let: M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

Then for all f, g, h ∈ M|Z:

(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)

Thus, the composition ∘ in M|Z is associative.
```

# 4. Axioms

### 4.1. Identity Element

**Unit Axiom 1: Identity Element Z**
```
id_Z:= Z → Z | Z
∀f ∈ M∣Z: id_Z ∘ f = f  and f∘id_Z = 
```

**Definition:**
```
Statement:
Z-frame itself is the unit of M | Z.

Formal Definition:
Z:= Z → Z∣Z

Justification:
Since any morphism in M | Z is defined as:

f: X→Y∣Z

and Z itself is defined as its own identity morphism:

Z:= Z→Z∣Z

then:
id_Z = Z

Conclusion:

Therefore:
id_Z is the unit element of M∣Z.

∀f ∈ M∣Z: (id_Z ∘ f | Z) = f and (f ∘ id_Z | Z)= f
(with frame-preserving composition)

∴id_Z​ is the unit of M∣Z.

```

Note: 
```
idZ​ :Z→Z ∣ Z
f:X→Y ∣ Z
(idZ​∣Z)∘(X→Y∣Z)
```

**Unit Axiom2: Void Concept**
```
f ∈ M|Z 
"" ∘ f = f  and f ∘ "" = f 
id_Z ∘ f = f and f ∘ id_Z = f
```

**Definition:**
```

The empty concept is a theoretically assumed concept, denoted as "", 
which acts as the unit element at the conceptual / lexical level.

Formal Definition:

"" ∘ f = f and f ∘ "" = f

Justification:

The empty concept "" represents no lexical or semantic content. 
Composing any morphism f with the empty concept does not alter the flow of meaning.
Conclusion:

"" is the unit element at the conceptual level of Conceptual Topology.

```

</br>

### 4.2. Zero Morphism: Negation Morphism
We define semantic zero morphism, negation morphism: n_f
​In CT as the result of applying Not() to a morphism 

```
g:σ(Z). Not(g){ A ↛ B | Z} = A ↛ B∣Z = n_f
where: g: A → B

Formal Properties (Axiom):

∀g:X→Y∣Z where composition with n_f​ is defined:

∀g: g ∘ n_f = n_f and n_f ∘ g = n_f

Left Side:
g: A→B 
g∘(A↛B∣Z) = A↛ B∣Z

Right Side
g: A→B(A↛B∣Z)∘g=A↛B∣Z


Interpretation:
Applying Not() to any morphism produces a semantic zero morphism, which collapses any further semantic flow.

Natural Language:
Left Side: g∘(A↛B∣Z)
"A is not B"
The apple is not a fruit

Right Side: (A↛B∣Z)∘g
"B is not A"
This is a fruit, but this is not an apple which is a fruit.


In CT, this was called rutpure(). 
Now defined:
rupture(A,B,Z)= σ(Z).Not(g) = n_f = A↛B∣Z

```

### 4.3. Composition Axiom
```
M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

Then for all f, g, h ∈ M|Z:

For f, g, h ∈ M|Z, 
where:
f:V → W | Z
g:Y → V | Z
h:X → Y | Z

(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)
```

**Example:**
```
For f, g, h ∈ M|Z, 

where:
f:she → you | Human
g:he → she | Human
h:man → he | Human

(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)

```

# 5. Conceptual Topos

### 5.1. Category Level: Initial Object

**Definition:**

```
Let Concept be a category where Ob(Concept) are lexical / conceptual objects.
Then "" ∈ Ob(Concept) is Initial Object if:

∀ X ∈ Ob(Concept), ∃ unique morphism:

u_X : "" → X | X

such that:

∀ f: X → Y | Z,  
f ∘ u_X = u_Y  
```

### Monoid Level: Unit in M|Z

```
Recall:

M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }  

Now, define:

"" ∈ Ob(Concept)  

and identity morphism under Z-frame:

e|Z_"" := id_"" | Z  

Then for all f ∈ M|Z:

e|Z_"" ∘ f = f  
f ∘ e|Z_"" = f  
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.2. Finite Limits

**Terminal Object**
Conceptual Topos defines a terminal object as the Z-frame identity:

```
id_Z := Z → Z | Z


Any morphism f: X → Z | Z factors uniquely through id_Z.

This realizes the semantic universal target:

∀ X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), ∃! f_terminal: X → Z | Z
```

**Example:**
```
she → human | Human
me → human | Human
```

### Pullback
```
Given morphisms:

f: girl → mammal  
g: puppy → mammal

Pullback of (f, g) is:

P = Baby  
p₁: Baby → girl  
p₂: Baby → puppy

with commuting condition:

f ∘ p₁ = g ∘ p₂  ≈ mapping to common semantic frame (mammal)

Diagram:

      Baby
     /    \
  p₁ /      \ p₂
   /          \
girl          puppy
   \          /
    \        /
     v      v
     mammal (semantic anchor / codomain)

```

This previously defined as Quasi-Natural Transformation:
```
η: Dᵢ ⇒ Dᵢ₊₁  | CD (CD = codomain)
η_X ∘ Dᵢ({f₁ | Z₁, ..., fₙ | Zₙ}) ≈ Dᵢ₊₁({f′₁ | Z₁, ..., f′ₙ | Zₙ}) ∘ η_Y | CD
for all fⱼ: Xⱼ → Yⱼ | Zⱼ ∈ Dᵢ,  
where f′ⱼ: η_X(Xⱼ) → η_Y(Yⱼ) | Zⱼ

Then, η is said to be a quasi-natural transformation under the Z-frame
i.e. η ∈ Mor(C) where C is the contextual meaning category

η_X ∘ Dᵢ({girl → mammal | Z₁}) ≈ Dᵢ₊₁({puppy → mammal | Z₂}) ∘ η_Y


Pullback Diagram
      Mammal
     /     \
    /       \
girl         puppy
   \         /
    \       /
     Baby  (semantic anchor / common Z-frame)


Example: η: girl → puppy | Z = Baby


Quasi-Natural Transformation Diagram:
        Z = baby
    puppy  ←   girl    //specified: size + young
     |          |
     |          |
    dog        she     //abstraction
      \        /      
        Mammal

```

### 5.3. Exponentials    

Conceptual Topos models exponentials via semantic shift operators.

### Definition

```
For any objects A, B:

B^A exists such that:
Hom(X ⊗ A, B) ≅ Hom(X, B^A)
```

### Construction via σ operator

Semantic shift operators:
```
σ(Z). >>(A, B)
or
σ(Z). >(A, B)

act as internal exponential morphisms within the fibered structure over the Z-frame:
        (A, B, Z) ≅ B^A
where the Z-frame mediates the contextual semantic continuity of the morphic shift.

```

**Definition: Semantic Shifting Morphism (σ)**

```
σ: D(Xₙ₋₁ | X) → D(Xₙ₋₁ | X)

such that σ ⊕ f ∈ M|Z if and only if type compatibility holds:

∀ A, B, (A → B) ∘ σ(X) is valid if:

( A >> X or X >> A )
and
( B >> X or X >> B )

Definition: Subsumption
A >> X ≡ A ⊑ X

Definition: SubsumedBy
X >> A ≡ X ⊑ A

Example:
king → king >> human → human
  ⇒ king >> human  → valid

human → human >> queen → queen
  ⇒ human >> queen → valid
```

### Example

```
σ(Human). >>(puppy → dog → mammal | Canine, Human)
≅ girl → she → mammal | Human
```

This shift realizes an internal semantic transformation corresponding to exponential behavior.


</br>

### 5.4. Definition of Ω

Let **Ω** be an object in the Concept category, representing the **semantic truth space**.

```
For any subobject (conceptual inclusion):

m: M ↪ X

there exists a unique characteristic morphism:

χ_m: X → Ω
```

such that the following diagram commutes:

```
M ————→ X
|       |
|       v χ_m
|       Ω
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Interpretation in Conceptual Topology

- **Ω** encodes **semantic entailment / membership / inclusion**.
- **Z-frame membership** is naturally mapped to Ω:

```
χ_Z: X → Ω
```

interpreted as:  
"Does X conceptually belong to Z-frame Z?"


### Examples

**Example 1: Dog in Pet Z-frame**

χ_Pet(Dog) = True

**Example 2: Apple in Pet Z-frame**

χ_Pet(Apple) = False

**Example 3: Innocent in Body Z-frame (after rupture)**

χ_Body("innocent") = True / False
depending on whether the semantic projection is coherent under Z-Frame.

<br/>

### Relation to Rupture

Semantic rupture can be lifted to Ω as:

σ(Z). Not(f: A → B | Z)
⇒ rupture(A,B,Z)
⇒ χ_Z(f) = False

Thus, **negation** and **semantic discontinuity** become **Ω-classifiable**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 5.5. Conceptual Topos as Fibered Topos over Z-frame

Conceptual Topos is structured as a **fibered topos** over the semantic base space **Z-frame**.

### Z-frame as Fibered Structure

- Let π: C ∪ D → Z be the semantic projection.
- Each fiber π⁻¹(Z) forms a category of morphic chains **D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z)**.
- Morphisms of the form:

```
X → Y | Z ≡ X → Y in fiber over Z
```
correspond to morphisms within the fibered structure over Z.

</br>

### Initial Object and Codomain Projection

- The **Initial Object ""** serves as the semantic origin.
- It projects into the codomain via:

```
"" → | X ≡ "" → π(X)
```

```
   "" 
    ↓ u_X
  X ————→ π(X) (in Z-frame)

```

```
Fiber π⁻¹(Z_X):
    "" → X → Y
```

Thus, semantic generation naturally occurs anchored in Z-frame.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Semantic Flow Closure

- Semantic flows:

```
X → Y | Z
```
are closed within the fiber over Z, corresponding to the codomain Z of the semantic projection π.


- Rupture and negation are classified by **Ω**:

```
χ_Z: X → Ω
```

</br>

# Conclusion

Conceptual Topos is a **fibered topos** over Z-frame:

```
π: C ∪ D → Z
```

with:

- Initial Object "" → codomain π(X)
- Morphic Chains as fibers π⁻¹(Z)
- Ω as subobject classifier in Z
- σ operator inducing internal exponential morphisms.
