## Monoid Structure of Semantic Flow (M|Z):
In Conceptual Topology, Z is defined as a mediating point/semantic anchor.
```
Let C and D, Z be categories,
with semantic projection π: C ∪ D → Z, such that for each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D):

π(X) ∈ Ob(Z)

For each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), there exists morphism:

f_X: X → π(X)
f_X⁻¹: π(X) → X
 
such that:

f_X⁻¹ ∘ f_X ≅ id_X

For morphism f: X → Y | Z,  
this corresponds to:

f_Z: π(X) → π(Y) in Z

For any X, Y ∈ Ob(C ∪ D):

Let [X]_Z := semantic representation of X under frame Z (i.e., π(X))

Then:

[ X ]_Z1 ≅ [ Y ]_Z2 | Z1, Z2 ∈ Z //or Z1, Z2 >> Z 
which means:
["Dog"]_Pet = [Retriever, Dachshund, Poodle, Bulldog, ...]
["girl"]_Human = [girl, woman, person, ...]
["Dog"]_Pet ≅ ["girl"]_Human | Life

Then the set of semantic flow morphisms under Z forms a monoid:

M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

This is also defined as Morphic Chain:

Let **D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z)** := Category of Morphic Chains over **Ob(Cₙ₋₁)** within a given Z-frame.
where:D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z) ={ C₀ → C₁ → C₂ → ... | Z }

or as a set
D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z) ={ C₀, C₁, C₂, ... | Z }
```

</br>

## Identity Element of M|Z
```
Let: M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

Define the identity element of M|Z as a family of identity morphisms over the shared Z frame:

For each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), there exists a unique identity morphism under a Z frame:

e|Z_X := id_X | Z

Then, for any f: X → Y | Z ∈ M|Z:

e|Z_X ∘ f = f
f ∘ e|Z_Y = f

Therefore, the identity structure of M|Z is given by the family:

{ id_X | Z | X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D) }

which forms a pointwise identity across the objects under the common Z frame.  
This ensures that M|Z satisfies the identity axiom of a monoid.
```

</br>

## Associativity of M | Z
```
Let: M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

Then for all f, g, h ∈ M|Z:

(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)

Thus, the composition ∘ in M|Z is associative.
```

# Axioms

## Identity Element

**Unit Axiom 1: Identity Element Z**
```
id_Z:= Z → Z | Z
∀f ∈ M∣Z: id_Z ∘ f = f  and f∘id_Z = 
```

**Definition:**
```
Statement:
Z-frame itself is the unit of M | Z.

Formal Definition:
Z:= Z → Z∣Z

Justification:
Since any morphism in M | Z is defined as:

f: X→Y∣Z

and Z itself is defined as its own identity morphism:

Z:= Z→Z∣Z

then:
id_Z = Z

Conclusion:

Therefore:
id_Z is the unit element of M∣Z.

∀f ∈ M∣Z: (id_Z ∘ f | Z) = f and (f ∘ id_Z | Z)= f
(with frame-preserving composition)

∴id_Z​ is the unit of M∣Z.

```

Note: 
```
idZ​ :Z→Z ∣ Z
f:X→Y ∣ Z
(idZ​∣Z)∘(X→Y∣Z)
```

**Unit Axiom2: Void Concept**
```
f ∈ M|Z 
"" ∘ f = f  and f ∘ "" = f 
id_Z ∘ f = f and f ∘ id_Z = f
```

**Definition:**
```

The empty concept is a theoretically assumed concept, denoted as "", 
which acts as the unit element at the conceptual / lexical level.

Formal Definition:

"" ∘ f = f and f ∘ "" = f

Justification:

The empty concept "" represents no lexical or semantic content. 
Composing any morphism f with the empty concept does not alter the flow of meaning.
Conclusion:

"" is the unit element at the conceptual level of Conceptual Topology.

```


## Zero Morphism: Negation Morphism
We define semantic zero morphism, negation morphism: n_f
​In ACT as the result of applying Not() to a morphism 

```
g:σ(Z). Not(g){ A ↛ B | Z} = A ↛ B∣Z = n_f
where: g: A → B

Formal Properties (Axiom):

∀g:X→Y∣Z where composition with n_f​ is defined:

∀g: g ∘ n_f = n_f and n_f ∘ g = n_f

Left Side:
g: A→B 
g∘(A↛B∣Z) = A↛ B∣Z

Right Side
g: A→B(A↛B∣Z)∘g=A↛B∣Z


Interpretation:
Applying Not() to any morphism produces a semantic zero morphism, which collapses any further semantic flow.

Natural Language:
Left Side: g∘(A↛B∣Z)
"A is not B"
The apple is not a fruit

Right Side: (A↛B∣Z)∘g
"B is not A"
This is a fruit, but this is not an apple which is a fruit.


In ACT, this was called rutpure(). 
Now defined:
rupture(A,B,Z)= σ(Z).Not(g) = n_f = A↛B∣Z

```

## Composition Axiom
```
M|Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z ⋏ ∀ i, j: fᵢ ≅ fⱼ | Z }

Then for all f, g, h ∈ M|Z:

For f, g, h ∈ M|Z, 
where:
f:V → W | Z
g:Y → V | Z
h:X → Y | Z

(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)
```
