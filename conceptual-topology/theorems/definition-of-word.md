# The Definition Of Word
A word that includes itself or other words is subsumed by a higher-order concept.
That concept, in turn, is structurally embedded within the word.
Therefore, a word is a self-referential structure.

```
// A concept is a structure of oppositional differences
Let C be a concept //e.g. black
Let OC be the opposite concept //e.g. white
C = {−OC₁, −OC₂, ..., −OCₙ}

// A word is a concept, and belongs to the category of words
word ≅ C and Ob(Word) ∋ word

// A concept is a bundle of semantic morphisms (in the word2vec sense)
// Interpretable as a more concrete model via Grothendieck fibration
∀ fᵢ ∈ Mor(C), ∃∞_f s.t. fᵢ ⊆ ∞_f

// The structure of semantic morphisms is abstracted into a word
∀ ∞_f, ∃ Word s.t. ∞_f ⊆ Word

// The ∞-structure of morphisms is deployed into the linguistic category as a natural transformation
and then: Word≅Nat(h∞f​,Language)

// Self-identity of the word: word is word
id_word ≈word
