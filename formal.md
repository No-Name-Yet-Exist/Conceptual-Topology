# Global Definition of Conceptual Topology: Morphic Chain Structure

```
CT := (C, B, π: E → B, Fb := π⁻¹(b), A ≅ b ⋃ Nat(Hom(−, A), Fb))

Where:
  - C is the category of concepts (objects = words or concepts)
  - B is the base space of Z-frames (semantic continuity anchors)
  - E is the total semantic space (word vector embedding space)
  - π projects each concept to its semantic base (Z-frame)
  - Fb is the fiber (semantic morphic chain) over a base b
  - A ≅ b ⋃ Nat(Hom(−, A), Fb) interprets each concept A via its morphisms relative to its   Z-frame b (Yoneda perspective defined in appendix)
```

```
        Z = baby  
    puppy  ←   girl    //specified: size + young
     |          |
     |          |
    dog        she     //abstraction
      \        /      
        Mammal

```

# Local Semantic Flow under Z Frame

### Identity Morphism

In Category Theory, Identity Morphism is always defined.
```
id_X: X → X
such that for any f: X → Y:
f ∘ id_X = f
id_Y ∘ f = f
```

However, in Conceptual Topology, morphisms are mediated by Z frame, thus
the identity morphis is not always given unless Z is defined.

**Two Types of Identity Morphism in Conceptual Topology**
1. f: X → X | X  (Category-theoretic identity)
2. f: X → X | Z  (Mediated identity with semantic flow)


```
f: X → X | X
such that for any f: X → Y:
f ∘ id_X = f
id_Y ∘ f = f

e.g. f: dog → dog | dog
```

In Conceptual Topology there is another type of identity morphism.
This type involves semantic flow.

```
f: X → X | Z

f: X → Z
f⁻¹: Z → X
f⁻¹ ∘ f ≅ id_X
e.g. you → you | externalized perspective
     NL: you are you
```

Since the identity morphism is passes through an external anchor point,
the identity morphism is defined quasi-identical.</br>
e.g. dog → perro | собака

</br>

**Simplified Form of Identity Morphism:**

1. f: X → X | X  (Category-theoretic identity) </br>
　In simplified form: X </br>
  or more explicitly: id_X </br>
  
2. f: X → X | Z  (Mediated identity with semantic flow)</br>
　In simplified form: X | Z</br>


### Mirror Morphism Definition:
Each mirror maps conceptual transitions across vocabularies while preserving morphic identity up to rupture—that is, it allows for semantic divergence that still respects underlying structural continuity, even if exact invertibility is not preserved.

```
f : X  → Y  | Z ∈ Dᵢ
f′: X′ → Y' | Z ∈ Dᵢ₊₁
  ⇒X′ ≠ X, but cod(f) = cod(f′) | CD (CD = codomain)

We define f′ as a mirror-correspondent morphism of f under a given Z-frame,
if and only if:

∃Z: rupture(f, f′ | Z) ≠ ∅ 
∧ cod(f) = cod(f′) | CD
```

```
        Z = baby  
    puppy  ←   girl    //specified: size + young
     |          |
     |          |
    dog        she     //abstraction
      \        /      
        Mammal

```

**Note:** **Z: rupture(f, f′ | Z) ≠ ∅** means that there exists a Z-frame under which *f* and *f′* exhibit structural divergence—i.e., they are not fully invertible but still converge at the codomain level.

For example, let *Z = abstraction*. This allows a semantic transition from *girl → she* and *puppy → dog*, treating them as mirror morphisms under a shared conceptual frame.  
However, if we take *Z = agency*, a rupture emerges: *puppy → dog* lacks agency, while *girl → she* retains it. Hence, **rupture(f, f′ | agency) ≠ ∅**, yet *f* and *f′* still align toward the same codomain (e.g., *mammal*).

</br>

### Quasi-Natural Transformation of Meaning Systems

A **Morphic Chain Mirror** is a contextual correspondence between two morphic chains drawn from distinct but meaning-aligned vocabularies. This correspondence is realized through a **quasi-natural transformation** under a shared intermidiating Z-frame.

```
η: Dᵢ ⇒ Dᵢ₊₁  | CD (CD = codomain)
η_X ∘ Dᵢ({f₁ | Z₁, ..., fₙ | Zₙ}) ≈ Dᵢ₊₁({f′₁ | Z₁, ..., f′ₙ | Zₙ}) ∘ η_Y | CD
for all fⱼ: Xⱼ → Yⱼ | Zⱼ ∈ Dᵢ,  
where f′ⱼ: η_X(Xⱼ) → η_Y(Yⱼ) | Zⱼ

Then, η is said to be a quasi-natural transformation under the Z-frame
i.e. η ∈ Mor(C) where C is the contextual meaning category
Example: η: girl → puppy | Z = baby
```

</br>

# Monoid Structure of Semantic Flow (M_Z)
In Conceptual Topology, Z is defined as a mediating point/semantic anchor.
```
Let C and D be categories with semantic projection to Z.

π_C: C → Z  
π_D: D → Z

Or jointly:  
π: C ∪ D → Z

For each X, there exists:

f_X: X → Z  
f_X⁻¹: Z → X

such that:

f_X⁻¹ ∘ f_X ≅ id_X

For morphism f: X → Y | Z,  
this corresponds to:

f_Z: π(X) → π(Y) in Z

For any X, Y ∈ Ob(C ∪ D):

[ X ]_Z ≅ [ Y ]_Z

Then the set of semantic flow morphisms under Z forms a monoid:

M_Z = { f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_1 | all f_i under Z }
```

**Example: Queen and King**
```
Let C be a concept
C = {−OC₁, −OC₂, ..., −OCₙ} // Yoneda's lemma and structralism

king = {Royalty⃗, Male⃗, Human⃗}
queen = {Royalty⃗, Female⃗, Human⃗} 
man = {Male⃗, Human}
woman =  {Female⃗, Human} 

{Royalty⃗, Male⃗, Human⃗} ⊖ {Male⃗} ⊕ {Female⃗} 
= {Royalty⃗, Female⃗, Human⃗} 
= queen


k₁: Human → Male | king  
k₂: Male → Royalty | king  

Then:  
k₂ ∘ k₁: Human → Royalty | king


q₁: Human → Woman | queen  
q₂: Woman → Royalty | queen  

Then:  
q₂ ∘ q₁: Human → Royalty | queen

m: Human → Male
f: Human → Female

Cross-Z-frame composition:

(k₂ ∘ k₁) ⊕ (q₂ ∘ q₁)= Human → Royalty | Z'

If higher Z' (e.g. "Humanity" or "Social Role") unifies Z = king and Z = queen:

Then:
(k₂ ∘ k₁) ⊕ (q₂ ∘ q₁) ∈ M_Z'

```

</br>

### Identity Element of M_Z
```
Let: M_Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z }

Define the identity element of M_Z as a family of identity morphisms over the shared Z frame:

For each X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), there exists a unique identity morphism:

e_Z(X) := id_X | Z

Then, for any f: X → Y | Z ∈ M_Z:

e_Z(X) ∘ f = f
f ∘ e_Z(Y) = f

Therefore, the identity structure of M_Z is given by the family:

{ id_X | Z | X ∈ Ob(C ∪ D) }

which forms a pointwise identity across the objects under the common Z frame.  
This ensures that M_Z satisfies the identity axiom of a monoid.
```

### Associativity of M_Z
```
Let:

M_Z = { fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₁ | all fᵢ: Xᵢ → Xᵢ₊₁ | Z }

Then for all f, g, h ∈ M_Z:

(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)

Thus, the composition ∘ in M_Z is associative.
```


**Example:**</br>
```
σ_id(word) = word → σ_id = e_Z
Note: The definition of σ is provided in the following section.
```

**Example: Cross Category Identity Morphism**
```
dog ∈ Ob(pet)  
dog ∈ Ob(animal)  

dog → dog | Z=domesticated  
```

</br>

# Definition: Semantic Shifting Morphism (σ)

```
σ: X → X | X
such that σ ⊕ f ∈ M_Z if and only if type compatibility holds:

∀ A, B, (A → B) ∘ σ is valid if:

( A >> X or X >> A )
and
( B >> X or X >> B )

Definition: Subsumption
A >> X ≡ A ⊑ X

Definition: SubsumedBy
X >> A ≡ X ⊑ A

Example:
King >> Human
Human >> Queen
```

**Semantic Operators**
Semantic Operator σ modifies morphism as follows.
```
σx. Not(x){ A ↛ B | Z}     →     Rupture under Z frame
σx. so_much(x){A → B | Z}  →     Preservation & amplification under Z frame
σx. >>(x,y)                →     Semantic Shifting x to y (Generalization) as function form
σx. <<(x,y)                →     Downward Shifting x to y (Specialization) as function form
σx. >(x,y)                 →     Semantic Mapping 
```


**Semantic Morphism Set Operators**

```
Addition (⊕):
σx. ⊕(f, Aₙ₋₁ | CD): D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z') | CD
σx. ⊕(f₁, f₂) : Aₙ₋₁ :={f₁, f₂}

Subtraction (⊖):
⊖: Aₙ₋₁ ⊖ {f_i} 
σx. ⊖(f, Aₙ₋₁ | CD): D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z') | CD  

- ⊕ operator is σ_safe if CD alignment is preserved.
- ⊖ operator is potentially σ_unsafe but can be σ_safe if resulting chain preserves CD.
```

**Example**

```
{Royalty⃗, Male⃗, Human⃗} ⊖ {Male⃗} ⊕ {Female⃗} 
= {Royalty⃗, Female⃗, Human⃗} 
= queen
```

### Semantic Mapping
```
C_chain = { f₁, f₂, ..., fₙ } ∈ D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z)

σx: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) > D(Bₙ₋₁ | Y) | CD
where:
D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) = source morphic chain
D(Bₙ₋₁ | Y) = target morphic chain
CD = codomain alignment (semantic anchor)

σx is not strict functorial → quasi-alignment under semantic equivalence

σx ≈ η: Dᵢ ⇒ Dᵢ₊₁ | CD (Quasi-Natural Transformation interpretation)

Example:
σx. >(puppy → dog → mammal, Human) ∋ Girl → She → Mammal

```

### Identity Morphism of σ

```
word is word
thus:
word ≅ Nat(Hom(-, word), Fib(word)) 

σ_id = σ such that σ(f) = f for all f ∈ Hom(X, X)

σ_id(word) = word
σ_id(f) = f  for all f: word → word | word

M_Z = { f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_1 | all f_i under Z }
σ_id ∈ M_Z
σ ∘ σ_id = σ
σ_id ∘ σ = σ
∴ word is word and word is word
```

### Associativity of σ
```
σ₁: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z₁) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z₂) | CD₁
σ₂: D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z₂) → D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z₃) | CD₂

Then the composition:
σ_comp = σ₂ ∘ σ₁
is a morphism:

σ_comp: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z₁) → D(Cₙ₋₁ | Z₃) | CD₃

where:
CD₃ is determined by the alignment of CD₁ and CD₂.

Associativity
For all σ₁, σ₂, σ₃ such that their domains/codomains match for composition:
(σ₃ ∘ σ₂) ∘ σ₁ = σ₃ ∘ (σ₂ ∘ σ₁)

Thus, σ operator composition is associative.
```


**Example:**
```
Step 1: Compose σ₂ ∘ σ₁
 σ₁ = >(Canine, Mammal)  
 σ₂ = >(Mammal, Animal)  
 σ₃ = >(Animal, LivingBeing)

 σ₂ ∘ σ₁ 
 = >(Mammal, Animal) ∘ >(Canine, Mammal) 
 = >(Canine, Animal)

Step 2: Compose (σ₃ ∘ σ₂) ∘ σ₁
 σ₃ ∘ σ₂ 
 = >(Animal, LivingBeing) ∘ >(Mammal, Animal) 
 = >(Mammal, LivingBeing)

 σ₃ ∘ (σ₂ ∘ σ₁) 
 = >(Animal, LivingBeing) ∘ >((Mammal, Animal) ∘ >(Canine, Mammal) )
 = >(Animal, LivingBeing) ∘ >(Canine, Animal)
 = >(Canine, LivingBeing)

 (σ₃ ∘ σ₂) ∘ σ₁
 = (>(Animal, LivingBeing) ∘ >(Mammal, Animal))∘ >(Canine, Mammal)
 = >(Mammal, LivingBeing) ∘ >(Canine, Mammal)
 = >(Canine, LivingBeing)

Conclusion:
 (σ₃ ∘ σ₂) ∘ σ₁ = σ₃ ∘ (σ₂ ∘ σ₁)
 Both yield:
 > (Canine, LivingBeing)
```
Note: Morphic Chain D does not require the number of objects to be more than one

</br>

### x Safe / Unsafe Semantic Shifting Morphism (σ)
**Definition of Safe and Unsafe σ Operator**
Semantic Shifting Morphism (σ) can be classified based on whether it preserves the global coherence of the morphic chain.

**Safe σ Operator (σ_safe)**
Acts on the entire morphic chain as a coherent transformation.
```
σ_safe: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) > D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z') | CD
```

Behaves as a Quasi-Natural Transformation
```
σ_safe ≈ η: Dᵢ ⇒ Dᵢ₊₁ | CD
```

Composition is associative:
```
(σ₃ ∘ σ₂) ∘ σ₁ = σ₃ ∘ (σ₂ ∘ σ₁)
```
Resulting chain remains in M_Z or M_{Z'} (closed).

**Example**
```
σx. >(Canine, Mammal)
σx. >(Mammal, Animal)
σx. >(Animal, LivingBeing)

Composition:
(σ₃ ∘ σ₂) ∘ σ₁ = σ₃ ∘ (σ₂ ∘ σ₁)
→ >(Canine, LivingBeing)

Entire morphic chain is preserved.
```

</br>

**Unsafe σ Operator (σ_unsafe)**
Does not preserve global coherence of the morphic chain.
Acts locally or in a decomposed manner.

Chain may collapse:
```
σ_unsafe: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → { rupture(f₁), rupture(f₂), ..., rupture(fₙ) }
```

```
rupture(f, σ(f) | Z) ≠ ∅
```
Cannot be captured by a Quasi-Natural Transformation globally.


**Example**

```
σx. Not(x) { A ↛ B | Z }

Result:
rupture(A ↛ B | Z)
→ breaks the morphic flow → chain decomposes.
```




### Example: Morphic Shifting and Cross-Z-frame Semantic Flow

We consider the well-known semantic analogy:
**king - man + woman = queen**

We formalize this using Conceptual Topology's morphic flow.

```
Concept Definitions

Let C be a concept:

// (Yoneda's lemma and structuralism — concept defined by oppositional components)
C = {−OC₁, −OC₂, ..., −OCₙ}  

We define king as:

k₁: Human → Male | king  
k₂: Male → Royalty | king  

Then:  
k₂ ∘ k₁: Human → Royalty | king

We define queen as:
q₁: Human → Woman | queen  
q₂: Woman → Royalty | queen  

Then:  
q₂ ∘ q₁: Human → Royalty | queen

We define semantic editing morphisms σ within the Human frame:

σ: Human → Human | Human (A ∘ B | Human)  
= (Human → Human | Human) ⊕ (A ∘ B | Human)  
= Human → Human | Human
since:
M_Z = { f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_1 | all f_i under Z }

Thus formally:
σ(m⁻¹ ∘ f)
= (Male → Human)∘(Human → Female) | Human ⊕ (Human → Human | Human)
= Human → Human | Human

where:
m⁻¹: Male → Human  
f: Human → Female

And:
Male >> Human  
Female >> Human

(Male → Human) ∘ (Human → Female) ⊑ (Human → Human)

Then:
(k₂ ∘ k₁) ∘ σ(m⁻¹ ∘ f): Human → Royalty | Human


Assuming a higher semantic frame Z' (e.g., Humanity, Social Role) that unifies king and queen frames:

(k₂ ∘ k₁) ∘ σ ∈ M_Z'

Thus:

king - man + woman = queen
is formalized as:  

(k₂ ∘ k₁) ∘ σ ∈ M_Z'
```

</br>

# Cross-Category Flow Condition
Conceptual Topology allows communicative diagram across categories as long as same Z is shared: shared semantic equivalence.

```
Let C and D be categories with Z-frame semantic anchoring.
If all morphisms involved are of the form:
f: X → Y | Z

and semantic equivalence holds:
∀ X, Y ∈ Ob(C ∪ D), [X]_Z ≅ [Y]_Z

then semantic flow forms a monoid over Z-frame:
M_Z = { f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_1 | all f_i under Z }

```

**Example: Cross-Category Flow under Z-frame**</br>
This example illustrates how morphic flow can traverse categories (livestock, pet)  
as long as semantic equivalence under Z = domesticated is preserved.

```
(dog ≅ cat ≅ pig) | Z = domesticated
Ob(livestock) = {pig} 
Ob(pet) = {dog, cat}

f₁: pig → cat | Z
f₂: cat → dog | Z
f₃: dog → pig | Z
Then:
f₃ ∘ f₂ ∘ f₁: pig → pig | Z ∈ M_Z
```

**σ Operator**

```
σx. Not(x){ A ↛ B | Z}     →     Rupture under Z frame
σx. so_much(x){A → B | Z}  →     Preservation & amplification under Z frame
σx. >>(x,y)                →     Semantic Shifting x to y (Generalization) as function form
σx. <<(x,y)                →     Downward Shifting x to y (Specialization) as function form
σx. >(x,y)                 →     Semantic Mapping 
```

</br>

**Semantic Morphism Set Operators**

```
Addition (⊕):
σx. ⊕(f, Aₙ₋₁ | CD): D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z') | CD
σx. ⊕(f₁, f₂) : Aₙ₋₁ :={f₁, f₂}

Subtraction (⊖):
⊖: Aₙ₋₁ ⊖ {f_i} 
σx. ⊖(f, Aₙ₋₁ | CD): D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z') | CD  

- ⊕ operator is σ_safe if CD alignment is preserved.
- ⊖ operator is potentially σ_unsafe but can be σ_safe if resulting chain preserves CD.
```

</br>

**σ Typing Hierarchy**

σ_safe: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → D(Bₙ₋₁ | Z') | CD (Preserves global coherence)
σ_unsafe: D(Aₙ₋₁ | Z) → { rupture(f₁), ..., rupture(fₙ) } (Global coherence lost)

Note: σ_safe behaves as Quasi-Natural Transformation.  
      σ_unsafe induces rupture, and cannot be captured globally.
